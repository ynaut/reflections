R1: What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need it?

You need it to keep track of changes, to be able to make commits of the different states.

R2: How is the staging area differnt form the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is really just a preperation for a commit. Here you can decide which files should be commited. It's important for making logical commits. It's something that only exists temporarirly and is strictly related to a commit and nothing else.
