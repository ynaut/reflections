R1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I need to acess the project from different computers or if I need other people to be able to acess it.
When I want others to be able to see and use the project.

R2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If several people are working on the same project the files might be out of sync.
Also if work has been done on different computers the automatic commits
might conflict with each other
