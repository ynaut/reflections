R1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I need to acess the project from different computers or if I need other people to be able to acess it.
When I want others to be able to see and use the project.

R2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If several people are working on the same project the files might be out of sync.
Also if work has been done on different computers the automatic commits
might conflict with each other

R3: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are basicly just clones of others projects on GitHub which link back to the original project.
If I would like to add to, fix a bug in or modify a public project on GitHub I would use a fork.
Then the original creator would get credit for his/her work and it would 
be easier for them to implement changes that I have made in the original.

Clones are just copies of projects, which can be made locally aswell as remote. 
Clones can be used to clone projects from other sources than github

Branches are branches of commits of the project-
Branches are useful when working on a project and wanting to do
experimental changes or doing special versions of the project.
Just generally useful whilst coding to keep structure and have 
back-up code so that you can run it.

R4: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
If for example you are working on the code and someone else has updated the
remote repository. Then you can look at this and implement the changes that might be
needed to merge the two versions.
